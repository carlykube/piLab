<h2> About CorreoDigi </h2>

<div>
	<p>The EWB-SMU piLab team is working to set up a raspberry-pi-powered computer lab in an Orphanage in Honduras. Our goal in creating the piLab is to open up communication between the children in Honduras and the people who visit the orphanage and then return to the United States. Through the piLab project, we aim to create an efficient and customizable method of establishing pi-powered computer labs in undeveloped parts of the world. </p>
	<p>To address the communication problem in the orphanage in Honduras, the piLab team will develop a custom, web-based application that the children in Honduras can use to communicate with their friends in the United States. The application will simulate traditional, letter-writing correspondence. To ensure that all parties can understand the application, we will design simple user interfaces in both English and Spanish. </p>
	<p> Once development of CorreoDigi is completed, the EWB-SMU piLab team will travel to Honduras and set up the piLab. During this time, we will teach the children how to use the application and gather information about how to improve CorreoDigiand what other software applications might be of interest to the children in the orphanage. We currently have plans to create gardening software as well as expanding CorreoDigi to include mentorship components. </p>
